# Event Form Fixes - Summary

## Date: 2025-01-27
## Status: Complete

This document summarizes all fixes applied to restore the Event form functionality for vendors in the MyEventLane frontend theme.

---

## Problems Identified

### 1. Layout (Width)
- **Issue**: Form was rendering in a narrow column (about half width) instead of the desired 70-80% viewport width
- **Root Cause**: Container styling was correct, but form element needed explicit width constraints

### 2. Conditional Fields (Booking Configuration)
- **Issue**: Conditional show/hide logic for RSVP/Paid/External booking fields worked in Gin admin theme but not in frontend theme
- **Root Cause**: Conditional Fields library and #states API needed proper initialization and event triggering after form restructuring

### 3. Location & Maps
- **Issue**: Lost address autocomplete search, venue name storage, and map rendering
- **Root Cause**: JavaScript field selectors couldn't find fields after form restructuring into container-based layout

### 4. Taxonomy Term Selection
- **Issue**: Unable to select taxonomy terms (categories) in Visibility & Promotion section
- **Root Cause**: Autocomplete dropdown z-index was too low, causing it to be hidden behind other elements

---

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Layout & Styling

**Files Modified:**
- `web/themes/custom/myeventlane_theme/src/scss/pages/_event-form.scss`
- `web/themes/custom/myeventlane_theme/src/scss/components/_event-form.scss`

**Changes:**
- Added explicit width constraints to ensure form uses full container width
- Ensured `.mel-container--form` properly constrains form to 70-80% viewport width on desktop
- Maintained mobile-first responsive design (full-width on mobile)

**Result:**
- Form now uses 70-80% viewport width on desktop, centered with proper margins
- Mobile layout remains full-width for optimal mobile experience

---

### 2. Conditional Fields (Booking Configuration)

**Files Modified:**
- `web/modules/custom/myeventlane_event/src/Form/EventFormAlter.php`
- `web/themes/custom/myeventlane_theme/src/js/event-form.js`

**Changes:**
- Enhanced library attachment to ensure `core/drupal.states` and `conditional_fields/conditional_fields` are properly loaded
- Added data attribute to booking type select for easier JavaScript targeting
- Updated JavaScript to properly trigger conditional_fields initialization
- Ensured #states selectors match Drupal's generated field names exactly

**Result:**
- Booking type switching (RSVP/Paid/External) now correctly shows/hides relevant fields
- Works in both frontend theme and admin theme
- Fields are properly hidden/shown when booking type changes

---

### 3. Location Autocomplete & Maps

**Files Modified:**
- `web/modules/custom/myeventlane_location/js/address-autocomplete.js`

**Changes:**
- Updated field selectors to find fields within restructured form containers (`.location`, `.mel-form-content`)
- Added fallback selectors to handle multiple container structures
- Enhanced venue name field detection to work with new form structure
- Improved widget container detection to work with form restructuring

**Result:**
- Address autocomplete search now works correctly
- Venue name is properly populated when address is selected
- Map preview renders correctly when coordinates are available
- Manual address entry still works if autocomplete fails

---

### 4. Taxonomy Term Selection

**Files Modified:**
- `web/themes/custom/myeventlane_theme/src/scss/components/_event-form.scss`

**Changes:**
- Increased z-index for taxonomy autocomplete dropdowns from 1000 to 10000
- Added proper positioning and styling for `.ui-autocomplete` elements
- Enhanced form item positioning to ensure autocomplete containers are accessible
- Added max-height and overflow handling for long dropdown lists

**Result:**
- Taxonomy term autocomplete dropdowns now appear above all other form elements
- Users can select categories and other taxonomy terms without z-index conflicts
- Dropdowns are properly styled and scrollable for long lists

## Technical Details

### Library Loading Order
The following libraries are now attached in the correct order:
1. `core/drupal.form` - Base form functionality
2. `core/drupal.states` - #states API for conditional fields
3. `conditional_fields/conditional_fields` - Enhanced conditional field behavior
4. `myeventlane_location/address_autocomplete` - Location autocomplete functionality
5. `myeventlane_theme/event-form` - Custom form enhancements

### Form Structure
The form is now organized into logical containers:
- `event_basics` - Title, description, hero image
- `date_time` - Start and end dates
- `location` - Venue name and address with autocomplete
- `booking_config` - Booking type and conditional fields
- `visibility` - Categories, tags, accessibility
- `attendee_questions` - Additional questions

### CSS Improvements
- Form cards use higher contrast borders and backgrounds
- Reduced vertical spacing for more compact layout
- Improved input field styling with better focus states
- Enhanced z-index management for overlays and dropdowns

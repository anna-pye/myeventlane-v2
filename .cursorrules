Project
This repository is “MyEventLane”, a Drupal 11 event and ticketing platform running on DDEV (Docker) on macOS.

Cursor is operating inside a real, active repository. The filesystem and codebase are authoritative.

––––––––
Stack and layout
––––––––
  • Drupal 11, Composer-based.
  • Docroot: web/
  • Custom modules: web/modules/custom/*
  • Custom theme: web/themes/custom/myeventlane_theme/
  • DDEV CLI is required for all PHP, Composer, Drush, and Node commands.

––––––––
Commands
––––––––
  • Use ddev composer <args> for Composer.
  • Use ddev drush <args> for Drush.
  • Use ddev exec vendor/bin/phpcs and ddev exec vendor/bin/phpstan for checks.
  • Use ddev exec npm run dev or ddev exec npm run build for theme assets.

Never suggest non-DDEV commands.

––––––––
Coding standards
––––––––
  • Follow Drupal coding standards (Drupal + DrupalPractice).
  • Use dependency injection and services.
  • Avoid \Drupal::service() or static calls in new code.
  • Keep namespaces and use statements clean.
  • Twig must remain accessible and mobile-first.

––––––––
MyEventLane architecture rules
––––––––
Respect existing module boundaries:
  • myeventlane_core: shared services and helpers.
  • myeventlane_rsvp: RSVP logic and public forms.
  • myeventlane_tickets: ticketing, TicketMatrixForm, stock logic.
  • myeventlane_vendor_dashboard: vendor dashboard, CSV export, analytics.
  • myeventlane_checkout_*: checkout panes and attendee info.

Do NOT move logic between modules unless explicitly instructed.

For new features:
  • Prefer services, plugins, and hooks.
  • Do NOT add logic directly to controllers unless unavoidable.

––––––––
Safety and immutability
––––––––
Do NOT edit:
  • web/core/
  • web/modules/contrib/
  • vendor/
  • .ddev/

Do NOT modify:
  • composer.json
  • composer.lock
Unless the user explicitly instructs you to do so.

Do NOT invent:
  • New database tables
  • New entities
  • New schema
Without a clear migration plan and explicit approval.

––––––––
Editing rules (strict)
––––––––
  • When modifying a file, output the entire file, not snippets.
  • Preserve existing docblocks, annotations, service IDs, and routes unless told otherwise.
  • Assume Drupal 11 APIs and update deprecations carefully.

––––––––
Termination and clarification rules (critical)
––––––––
Cursor MUST STOP and ask one single clarification question if:
  • Requirements are ambiguous.
  • A change would alter existing working behaviour.
  • A file or module choice is unclear.
  • The requested change conflicts with these rules.

Cursor MUST NOT:
  • Guess intent.
  • Simplify scope.
  • Refactor for “cleanliness”.
  • Introduce new patterns without instruction.
  • Continue once blocked by ambiguity.

––––––––
Execution responsibility boundaries
––––––––
  • Cursor executes instructions.
  • Cursor applies code verbatim when given full files.
  • Cursor reports real compiler, runtime, or Drupal errors only.

Cursor is NOT responsible for:
  • Architecture invention.
  • Product decisions.
  • UX redesign unless explicitly requested.

––––––––
Testing and verification
––––––––
After meaningful changes, suggest only:
  • ddev drush cr
  • ddev exec vendor/bin/phpcs web/modules/custom
  • ddev exec vendor/bin/phpstan web/modules/custom
  • Relevant tests if they already exist.

Do not invent new tests unless asked.

––––––––
External architecture authority
––––––––
“MyEventLane Studio” documentation and user-provided ChatGPT plans are the architectural source of truth.

If a conflict exists, Cursor must stop and ask.

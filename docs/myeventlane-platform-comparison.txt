PRIORITY GAP ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Based on impact for organisers and attendees, achievability within codebase, and alignment with MyEventLane's community-first, multi-vendor model, the top three gaps to address are:

1. WAITLIST ENHANCEMENTS (High Priority)
   - Impact: High - directly affects attendee experience and conversion
   - Achievability: High - existing infrastructure supports this well
   - Alignment: Strong - improves community engagement
   - Focus areas:
     * Verify and complete automatic email notifications on promotion
     * Waitlist position display for attendees (frontend)
     * Waitlist analytics for vendors (conversion rates, time metrics)
     * Waitlist management interface (list view, export)
     * Reserved purchase window with tokens for promoted waitlist members

2. VENDOR ANALYTICS DASHBOARD (High Priority)
   - Impact: High - enables data-driven event management
   - Achievability: Medium-High - services exist, needs visualisation and integration
   - Alignment: Strong - empowers vendors to improve their events
   - Focus areas:
     * Chart visualisation integration (Chart.js)
     * Enhanced vendor dashboard integration and navigation
     * Conversion funnel tracking implementation
     * Revenue breakdowns by ticket type
     * Exportable PDF reports
     * Comparative analytics across events

3. ACCESSIBILITY DATA CAPTURE AND FILTERING (High Priority)
   - Impact: High - improves inclusivity and attendee experience
   - Achievability: High - taxonomy and field system already in place
   - Alignment: Strong - aligns with community-first values
   - Focus areas:
     * Add accessibility capture to RSVP forms
     * Event listing filters by accessibility
     * Visual accessibility indicators on event cards
     * Structured accessibility information fields (contact, directions, parking)
     * Accessibility data in exports
     * Expand accessibility taxonomy with icons

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

MyEventLane has a solid foundation with:
- Unified attendance management (EventAttendee entity)
- Flexible Commerce integration
- Multi-vendor architecture
- Analytics module structure in place
- Waitlist infrastructure with queue workers
- Accessibility taxonomy and data capture during ticket purchase

The primary gaps are in:
- User-facing features (waitlist visibility, analytics visualisation, accessibility filtering)
- Integration and completeness (ensuring all promotion paths send notifications, RSVP accessibility capture)
- Visual presentation (charts, icons, badges)

Addressing these three priority areas will significantly improve the platform's competitiveness while maintaining its community-focused, vendor-empowered model. The good news is that much of the backend infrastructure exists; the work is primarily in frontend integration, visualisation, and ensuring completeness across all user flows.

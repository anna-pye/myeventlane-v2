PRIORITY GAP ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Based on impact for organisers and attendees, achievability within codebase, and alignment with MyEventLane's community-first, multi-vendor model, the top three gaps to address are:

1. WAITLIST ENHANCEMENTS (High Priority)
   - Impact: High - directly affects attendee experience and conversion
   - Achievability: High - existing infrastructure supports this
   - Alignment: Strong - improves community engagement
   - Focus areas:
     * Automatic email notifications on promotion
     * Waitlist position display for attendees
     * Waitlist analytics for vendors

2. VENDOR ANALYTICS DASHBOARD (High Priority)
   - Impact: High - enables data-driven event management
   - Achievability: Medium-High - requires new views and services but foundation exists
   - Alignment: Strong - empowers vendors to improve their events
   - Focus areas:
     * Time-series sales charts
     * Conversion funnel tracking
     * Enhanced exportable reports

3. ACCESSIBILITY DATA CAPTURE AND FILTERING (High Priority)
   - Impact: High - improves inclusivity and attendee experience
   - Achievability: High - taxonomy and field system already in place
   - Alignment: Strong - aligns with community-first values
   - Focus areas:
     * Attendee accessibility requirement capture
     * Event listing filters by accessibility
     * Visual accessibility indicators

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

MyEventLane has a solid foundation with unified attendance management, flexible Commerce integration, and multi-vendor architecture. The primary gaps are in user-facing features (waitlist visibility, analytics dashboards, accessibility filtering) rather than core functionality.

Addressing these three priority areas will significantly improve the platform's competitiveness while maintaining its community-focused, vendor-empowered model.

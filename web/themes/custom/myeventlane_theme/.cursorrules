# MyEventLane Theme rules

- Respect pastel palette and spacing tokens already defined in SCSS.
- Keep layout mobile-first and avoid hard-coded pixel widths for large screens.
- When editing Twig in this theme, ensure:
  - No inline styles unless absolutely necessary.
  - Buttons and touch targets are at least 44x44px.
  - Markup remains compatible with Drupal's theme system (use attributes, title_prefix/title_suffix, etc.).
